        When it comes to investing for the future it is important to know the company your investing in. What i mean by this is,
        the company has to have long term value. Is the company consistently improving their products? For example, Apple is a prime example of a company 
        that constantly improves. Every IPhone that they came out with has drastically improved, whether it was there software or the physcial features of the phone,
        appple is constantly improving their products. Fundamentally, Apple is a company that would be great to invest in for long term growth.

        Another way companies get more shareholders in their stock is offering dividend when they purchase shares. A dividened is a distrubution of the companies 
        earnings to their shareholders. Dividends are distrubuted quarterly(every three months) and they are paid out directly in cash or the purchase of more shares
        with the company.
