        With this, Indicators can be used to help traders have more edge when they place trades. Only thing about technical indicators is that they are 
        lagging indicators. What i mean by this is price can have already reached a supply zone but certain  indicators wouldnt give you the confirmation to 
        sell until the price action move has already moved. Alot of new traders will soley rely on technical indicators to give them confirmation to put a trade on 
        yet or not. Technical indicators should only be used to give you a better edge in a trade. The trader should make sure the price action is aligned with
        with the technccial indicator.

        The Moving Average is used to help decide what trend price action is in. The moving averages are calculated by adding up all previous price data points
        during a specific period and dividing the sum by the time period. In the picture above you can see it has 3 different lines with numbers next to MA. 
        The black line that has 50 MA next to it is indicating price action over the last 50 candlesticks or days. Of course this will greatly depend on what
        timeframe you are trading off of. A trader that is day trading vs a trader that is swing trading moving averages will be different. They will be different because
        the moving averages that are moving on 15 minute time frames will be moving alot faster than moving averages on an 4 hour timeframe.

        The 20 moving average is used to asses the short term trend of price action. The 20 ema line can be used as a reversion to the mean after a extented trend has been formed.
        When price action is above the 20 ema it is seen to be in a strong bullish trend. When The price is underneath the 20 ema it is seen to be in a strong bearish trend.
        When taking trades you want to make sure price action is as close to the 20 ema as possible. In a strong uptrend you can often use the 20 as leverage to know when 
        to buy on pull backs of strong trends and you can use it to know when to sell in strong downtrends. In the picture above, you can see that when the price action
        was in a strong uptrend, when it came close to the 20 MA it went higher.
