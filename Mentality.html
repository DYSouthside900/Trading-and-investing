        In the trading world, aside from the technical 
        side of things ,if you simply dont have the correct 
        mindset to trade you will not be successful. Statistically
        only about 1-3% of people are profitable traders.
        How do the 1% consistently profit while the rest of the 
        trading world is struggling? We must first understand 
        that the markets are based off fear and greed. These 
        two human emotions are the most dominant ones we have hardest to get 
        in control of. This is what seperates the amateurs from the 
        pros. The pros understand that emotional intellihgence is 
        extremely important because we have no control of which way the markets go.

        When becoming a pro trader it isnt just about finding the million dollar trading strategy
        or being able to master all of the trading patterns, it is about developing a warrior mindset.

        When most traders start out trading, they think its about finding the perfect 
        trading indicators to help them dicate perfect timing on when the market will go up or down.
        The simple fact is the market will move however it wants to move. Do they move in certain patterns?
        Yes, but that doesnt mean it will always work. This is where the amateur trader has a hard time
        with. Its hard for them to accept that these things are in place only to give you more of an 
        advantage on a trade.

        Three major characteristics that seperate a pro trader from a amateur, is: Self-confidence,
        patience, and discipline. All traders that are profitable show a very high Self-confidence
        when they are placing there trades. They understand that the trade they are putting on isnt
        guranteed. The thought of them losing the trade dosent cross there mind. If they do experience 
        a losing trade, they shrug it off and focus on the next trade. With the amateur trader, after
        experiencing a losing trade negative thoughts start to come to mind. This losing trade rattles 
        their confident, so it stops them from taking the next trade. All pro traders are extremely patient.
        They know that waiting on a candle close gives them the confirmation they need. When approaching 
        a cerain level most amateur traders just blindly getting into a trading position when it comes to a support or 
        resistance. Lastly pro traders are very disciplined. They are very strict on risk management in their trading. 
        They understand that in order to be a successful trader you have to risk something. They want to
        aim for a 3:1 risk to reward ratio. what this means is your wins will be 3x more than your small loss
