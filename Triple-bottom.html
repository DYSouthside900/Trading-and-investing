            What is the psychology of the triple bottom pattern
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        The psychology behind the triple bottom pattern is that the sellers pushed the price action down to a certain support level.
        It bounced down off of the support level three times but could not make a newer low. With these bouncres off of support it created two neckline resistance.

            How to trade the Triple bottom and be profitable
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        1) The first way to trade the triple bottom pattern is to sell at neckline and buy at the support. In order to sell the neckline you must wait for it to 
        form first. When it returns back to neckline look to sell, and look to buy support.
    </div>
    <div>
        2) The second way to trade the triple bottom pattern is to wait on a change of character. After the three bottoms were formed and the two necklines have been formed 
        we want to see price action break above the neckline of this triple bottom. When it returns to the the previously formed neckline we than look to go long on this trade.
