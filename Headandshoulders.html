            What is the psychology behind the Head and shoulders pattern
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        The Psychology of the head and shoulders pattern is that price action broke the previous higher 
        high (Left shoulder), and now a new high (Head). In price action when it make a higher higher
        the previous high needs to hold as support. In this pattern that previous support does not hold, and prcie action keeps
        dropping past support. creating a change of character. It will bounce off the lower support level, than retrace back to left shoulder resistance,
        creating a right shoulder.

        to the neckline look to go short.

        3) The last way you can trade the head and shoulders pattern is to take a early trade at the right shoulder. Since the left shoulder support did not 
        hold from the head that was created, we would look to to short at this area.
